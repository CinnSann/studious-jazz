     <h2 class="topheader">MSIMBO</h3>
     <p class="us">MSIMBO translates to &quot;Code&quot; in Swahili. This 20 week bootcamp was created to supply the current demand in the tech industry â€” Diversity. This program is for the historically marginalized workers interested in learning to become web developers but have not had the opportunity presented to them. MSIMBO seeks to train talented individuals who are willing to take on the task of opening doors for themselves and others to join an industry that often over-looks us. Our coding bootcamp is intense but the skills and network created here will last a lifetime. ULEM looks to enroll 18 students and provide a stipend per week and transform them into full-stack web developers ready to launch a new career.</p>
